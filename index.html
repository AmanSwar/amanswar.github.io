                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I love to build fast systems. I’m an undergrad AI systems engineer obsessed with eliminating bottlenecks - whether that means writing custom CUDA/Triton kernels, optimizing inference paths, or redesigning entire pipelines from scratch. My work sits at the intersection of low-level systems engineering, high-performance computing, and modern machine learning.</p>
                <p>I operate across the full stack of ML development: reading papers, prototyping algorithms, engineering high-performance kernels, designing distributed training systems, and shipping production-ready infrastructure. I’ve built multiple end-to-end projects that move from research concepts to highly-optimized, real-world implementations.</p>
                <p>Right now, I’m going deep into computer architecture, operating systems, and compilers to sharpen the fundamentals behind fast code. I like hard problems, low-level detail, and just building things</p>
                <p>If you want to see what that looks like in practice, check my projects—they tell the story better than any bio.</p>
                <!-- <p>I am an undergrad AI systems engineer who hates slow code and works at the intersection of low-level systems engineering, high-performance computing, and modern machine learning.
My experience spans the entire machine learning lifecycle, from initial research and prototyping to the development and deployment of high-performance, scalable systems. 
Have made multiple projects across the stack from reading research papers to making custom kernels and everything in between.
Currently diving deep into Computer Architecture , OS and compilers cuz I love those stuff !!! + I love making projects !!! Check out my projects tab to see my work !
