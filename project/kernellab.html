                <h2>KernelLab: Technical Documentation</h2>

                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>KernelLab is a library of high-performance GPU kernels written in CUDA and Triton. It serves as a practical guide and reference for GPU programming, demonstrating various optimization strategies for common computational workloads in deep learning and scientific computing.</p>
                <p>The project is structured to provide a clear progression from simple, "naïve" implementations to highly optimized versions that leverage the full capabilities of modern GPU architectures. Each kernel is self-contained and comes with its own set of benchmarks, allowing for a clear understanding of the performance impact of each optimization.</p>

                <h3>2. Core Concepts in GPU Optimization</h3>
                <p>The optimizations implemented in KernelLab are based on the following core concepts of GPU programming:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Memory Hierarchy:</strong> GPUs have a complex memory hierarchy, consisting of global memory, shared memory, and registers. Efficiently managing data movement between these memory spaces is crucial for performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> GPUs are massively parallel processors. Structuring code to expose as much parallelism as possible is key to achieving high throughput.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Coalescing:</strong> Global memory accesses are most efficient when they are "coalesced," meaning that threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Shared memory is a small, fast, on-chip memory that can be used to cache frequently accessed data, reducing reliance on slower global memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warp-Level Primitives:</strong> A warp is a group of 32 threads that execute in lockstep. CUDA provides a set of "warp-level primitives" (e.g., <code>__shfl_down_sync</code>) that allow for efficient communication and data sharing between threads in a warp.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tensor Cores:</strong> Modern NVIDIA GPUs include specialized hardware units called Tensor Cores that are designed to accelerate matrix multiplication and other deep learning operations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Benchmarking and Performance</h3>
                <p>KernelLab includes a suite of benchmarks for comparing the performance of the different kernel implementations. The benchmarks are written in Python and use the <code>torch</code> library for creating and managing GPU tensors.</p>
                <p>The results of the benchmarks are presented in the <code>README.md</code> file and in the <code>benchmarks</code> directory.</p>

                <h3>5. How to Use KernelLab</h3>
                <p>The CUDA kernels are exposed to Python via Pybind11. Each kernel has a <code>setup.py</code> file that can be used to build and install the Python bindings.</p>
                <p>The Triton kernels can be used directly from Python.</p>

                <h3>6. Future Work</h3>
                <p>The <code>TODO.md</code> file lists the kernels and features that are planned for future development.</p>
